/*
  Tailwind CSS uses cascade layers to organize styles with a clear hierarchy: theme, base, components, and utilities.

  To maintain consistency and predictable style application:
  - Import external library styles within the vendor layer to contain third-party CSS.
  - Use the theme layer for foundational elements, such as font declarations.
  - Ensure that the cascade order aligns with Tailwindâ€™s design principles to avoid specificity conflicts.

  This approach guarantees that utility classes take precedence and prevents style overrides by third-party code.

  For reference, see the Tailwind CSS index file:
  https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/main/packages/tailwindcss/index.css
