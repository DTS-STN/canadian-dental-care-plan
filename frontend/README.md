# Welcome to Remix

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`

## Development Guideline

### Method Naming Conventions (Repository and Service)

This document provides guidelines for naming repository methods in TypeScript Node.js applications, focusing on consistency, clarity, immutability, and domain-specific terminology.

#### General Principles

- **Clarity:** Method names should clearly convey their intent and be easily understandable to developers unfamiliar with the code.
- **Consistency:** Adhere to a consistent pattern for method names across the repository layer.
- **Domain Language:** Use domain-specific terminology to improve readability and relevance to the business logic.
- **CRUD Operations:** Follow standard CRUD method prefixes where applicable (e.g., `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- **Immutability:** Consider using immutable objects and arrays to avoid unintended side effects. Utilize TypeScript's readonly properties where appropriate.
- **Error Handling:** Consider whether methods should throw an error or return `null` when no result is found.

#### Method Naming Guidelines

##### Retrieval (Read) Operations

1. **`get`:** Used to retrieve a single entity or value that is expected to exist. If not found, it may throw an error or handle it based on use-case.

   - Repository Example: `getUserById(id: number): Promise<UserEntity>`

2. **`find`:** Used when searching for one or more entities where results might not be found. These methods typically return `null` or `undefined` for single items, or an empty list for collections.

   - Repository Example: `findUserByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserEntity | null>`

3. **`list`:** Used to retrieve collections without specific filtering criteria, typically returning a full list of entities.
   - Repository Example: `listAllUsers(): Promise<UserEntity[]>`

##### Creation (Create) Operations

- **`create`:** Used for creating a new entity. Methods should clearly indicate if any side effects occur, such as persisting to a database.
  - Repository Example: `createUser(user: UserEntity): Promise<UserEntity>`

##### Update Operations

- **`update`:** Used for updating an existing entity. It’s important to ensure proper type safety, especially if partial updates are allowed.
  - Repository Example: `updateUserDetails(id: number, userDetails: Partial<UserEntity>): Promise<UserEntity>`

##### Deletion Operations

- **`delete`:** Used to remove an entity, usually returning `void` or a boolean indicating success.
  - Repository Example: `deleteUser(id: number): Promise<void>`

#### Additional Considerations

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Most repository methods in a Node.js context will be asynchronous. Use `async/await` or promises, ensuring all returned data is properly handled in an async context.

- **Immutability:** To ensure that objects and arrays remain immutable, consider returning readonly objects or using libraries such as Immutable.js for deeper immutability. This prevents unintended mutations that may cause bugs and ensures data integrity.

- **Custom Methods:** Incorporate domain-specific custom methods where needed, ensuring the method names still adhere to the `get`, `find`, `list`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` convention.

#### Example

##### Repository Interface

```typescript
import { UserEntity } from '../entities/user.entity';

export interface UserRepository {
  // Read Operations
  getUserById(id: number): Promise<UserEntity>;
  findUserByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserEntity | null>;
  findUsersByRole(role: string): Promise<UserEntity[]>;
  listAllUsers(): Promise<UserEntity[]>;

  // Create Operation
  createUser(user: UserEntity): Promise<UserEntity>;

  // Update Operation
  updateUserDetails(id: number, userDetails: Partial<UserEntity>): Promise<UserEntity>;

  // Delete Operation
  deleteUser(id: number): Promise<void>;

  // Domain-Specific Methods
  findActiveUsersByDepartment(department: string): Promise<UserEntity[]>;
  findUsersByAgeRange(minAge: number, maxAge: number): Promise<UserEntity[]>;
}
```

### Key Points to Remember

1. **Use** `get` for retrieving entities that are expected to exist, often throwing an error if not found.

2. **Use** `find` when there is uncertainty about whether the entity exists, allowing for `null` results or empty collections.

3. **Use** `list` for retrieving broad, unfiltered collections of entities.

4. **Immutability:** Where appropriate, return immutable objects and arrays or use tools to enforce immutability.

5. **TypeScript's Types:** Utilize TypeScript’s type system fully to express precise types for arguments and return values.

6. **Error Handling:** Consider whether the method should throw exceptions (for `get`) or return `null` (for `find`).
